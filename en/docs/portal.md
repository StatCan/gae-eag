##Overview

Collaboration and flexibility are central to ArcGIS Enterprise, allowing you to organize and share your work. Interactive and easy-to-read data visualizations including, map-centric apps, stories, dashboards, can be created using a no-code app builder.

- **Collaboration and Sharing**: Users can share their maps, data, and analysis results with others through collaboration groups and by creating web maps and applications.

- **Data Editing and Maintenance**: Users, based on permissions, can edit and update spatial datasets, adding, modifying, or deleting features.

- **Custom Application Development**: Skilled users can develop custom web applications and services.

- **Visualization and Reporting**: Users can create visually appealing maps, dashboards, and reports to effectively communicate their spatial analysis findings.
