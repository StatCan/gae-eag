##What is Geospatial Analysis? 

Geospatial analysis is the process of analyzing and interpreting data that has a geographic component. It involves studying maps, satellite imagery, and other spatial data to uncover patterns and insights related to specific locations. It helps in understanding how location impacts various phenomena and supports decision-making in fields like urban planning, environmental management, and disaster response.
